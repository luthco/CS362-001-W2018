Bug Report #1 - "Febuary Date Length"

This bug allows the month of Febuary to contain 29 days every occurance.  This is not possible,
as the maximum amount of days that the month of Febuary is aloud to have to 28 days (unless a 
leap year).  This bug is located on line 16 in the CalendarUtil.java file.

Section of Code:
	public static int DaysInMonth[] = {31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};

To recreate the bug, simply create a calendar event on Feburay 29th (The second value).  The 
Calendar program will allow this, even though it should not be possible.

In order to fix this bug, simply fix the upper boundary for the month of Febuary in the 
DaysInMonth array on line 16 in the CalendarUtil.java file.



Bug Report #2 - "Not showing first appointment for the day"

This bug prevents the first appointment from being displayed when using getApptRange.  This bug
is located on line 53 in the TimeTable.java file.

Section of Code:
	for (int i = 1; i < appts.size(); i++) { ...

To recreate this bug, simply add an apointment to the calendar.  Then use getApptRange to check 
for the appointment between the times in which the appointment was set.  You will see that no
appointments will be displayed.  If you add more appointments however, those will be displayed 
if you repeat the process again.

In order to fix this bug, you must set the lower boundary of the for loop shown above on line 53
to "int i = 0" instead of "int i = 1".  Once this boundary issue is fixed, this bug should be 
fixed.
